# T

Not sure what to describe it like , but it was partly inspired by Tetris.
Try to stack four blocks of the same number either vertically or horizontally to get points!

Try it out! [https://this-marwan.github.io/T/T.html]

T is built using the following technologies
- [X] JavaScript
- [X] HTML
- [X] CSS

The design layout is taken from an (incomplete) [game I made](https://github.com/this-marwan/TapTap "TapTap").

#### Future Possible Additions
- Color Schemes for numbers
- Adapt For Mobile
- Difficulty levels
